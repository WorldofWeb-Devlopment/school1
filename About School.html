        <div class="list-1">
            The schools under Dindigul Nadar Uravinmurai have long been a gift to the community, shaping the future of
            young minds. Established by visionary founders Shri Manickam Nadar and Shri Rathnapandian, these
            institutions continue to uphold their legacy of providing quality education and nurturing the leaders of
            tomorrow.

            The journey of DNU Trust began with the humble beginning of MSP School, which, though small institution, set
            the stage for an extraordinary path of success through immense hard work and dedication. The students of MSP
            School contributed immensely to this success, bringing glory to the institution and helping it grow into one
            of the top schools in the region. Inspired by the vision of the founders, the Dindigul Nadar Uravinmurai
            schools have consistently been a gift to the public, offering quality education to the younger generations.

            In 1980, SMBM Matriculation School was founded, followed by the establishment of KKAG Matriculation School
            in 2001, further cementing the trust’s commitment to excellence. This legacy of growth reached new heights
            with the establishment of DNU SMBM National Public School in 2017, now recognized for meeting global
            educational standards. The journey of DNU Trust is a testament to the unwavering dedication of its founders
            and the continued pursuit of educational excellence. Their leadership reflects a commitment to excellence,
            innovation, and the holistic development of students.

            Established during India’s awakening to freedom and independence, the DNU schools continue to uphold the
            vision of their great ancestors. They believed in nurturing emotionally resilient youth, instilling a strong
            sense of unity, and empowering future generations with values that stand the test of time.

            The school is named after the founding family as a mark of respect for their vision and dedication. Its logo
            beautifully represents and highlights the five essential qualities every student should embody.

            The school motto, <b>‘We Can & We Will,’ </b>reflects the unwavering spirit of the founders. It continues to
            inspire and adapt, ensuring that every new individual who walks through our doors embraces this vision with
            renewed energy and determination.
